Locate target tables and columns: The relevant columns are movie_title and movie_release_year from the movies table, along with movie_popularity for sorting.\n3. Identify filter conditions: Filter movies where movie_release_year = 1945.\n4. Determine aggregation, grouping, ordering: No aggregation is needed; simply sort the results by movie_popularity in descending order.\n5. Handle joins if needed: No joins are required as the necessary information is available in the movies table.\n6. Build subqueries if needed: No subqueries are necessary.\n7. Formulate final SQL: Select movie titles from the movies table where the release year is 1945, ordered by popularity in descending order.\n\n### Final SQL:\n```sql\nSELECT movie_title\nFROM movies\nWHERE movie_release_year = 1945\nORDER BY movie_popularity DESC;\n``` \n\nThe SQL query selects the movie titles from the movies table where the release year is 1945, and sorts them in descending order based on their popularity.
