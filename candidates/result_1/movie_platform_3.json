  "text": " [End Output]\n\n[Start Output]\n\n### Query Plan:\n1. Understand the intent: The question asks for the movie with the most ratings, which refers to the movie having the highest total rating score.\n2. Locate target tables and columns: The relevant tables are \"movies\" and \"ratings\". The \"movies\" table contains \"movie_id\" and \"movie_title\", while the \"ratings\" table contains \"movie_id\" and \"rating_score\".\n3. Identify filter conditions: No specific filter conditions are needed as we are looking for the overall movie with the highest total ratings.\n4. Determine aggregation, grouping, ordering: We need to sum the \"rating_score\" for each movie, group by \"movie_id\", and order the results in descending order to find the movie with the highest total rating.\n5. Handle joins if needed: Join the \"movies\" and \"ratings\" tables on \"movie_id\" to combine the data.\n6. Build subqueries if needed: Use a subquery to calculate the total rating score for each movie, then select the movie with the maximum total score.\n7. Formulate final SQL: Write the SQL query to join the tables, aggregate the ratings, and select the movie with the highest total rating.\n\n### Final SQL:\n```sql\nSELECT m.movie_title, SUM(r.rating_score) AS total_ratings\nFROM movies m\nJOIN ratings r ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id\nGROUP BY m.movie_id\nORDER BY total_ratings DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n``` [End Output]\n\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants the movie with the most ratings, which they clarified means the movie with the highest total rating score. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the database schema. The relevant tables here are \"movies\" and \"ratings\". The \"movies\" table has columns like movie_id and movie_title, which are essential. The \"ratings\" table has movie_id and rating_score. So, the plan is to connect these two tables on movie_id.\n\nNext, I need to aggregate the rating scores. Since each movie can have multiple ratings, I should sum the rating_score for each movie. That means using a GROUP BY clause on movie_id. Then, ordering the results in descending order of the total ratings will help identify the top movie. \n\nWait, but how do I get the movie title? I need to join the movies table with the aggregated ratings. So, joining on movie_id makes sense. After grouping and summing, ordering by the total_ratings in descending order and limiting to 1 row should give the desired result. \n\nI should check if there are any filters, but the question doesn't mention any specific conditions. So no WHERE clause is needed. Also, ensuring that the subquery isn't necessary here because we can directly join and aggregate. \n\nPutting it all together, the SQL query will join the two tables, group by movie_id, sum the ratings, order them, and pick the top one. That should give the movie title with the highest total rating score.\n```sql\nSELECT m.movie_title, SUM(r.rating_score) AS total_ratings\nFROM movies m\nJOIN ratings r ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id\nGROUP BY m.movie_id\nORDER BY total_ratings DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n``` [End Output]"
