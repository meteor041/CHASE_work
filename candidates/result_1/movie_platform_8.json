Locate target tables and columns: The relevant tables are 'ratings' for rating information and'movies' for movie titles. The 'ratings' table contains 'rating_timestamp_utc' and 'user_id', while the'movies' table has'movie_title'.\n3. Identify filter conditions: Filter ratings where 'rating_timestamp_utc' is in April 2020 (LIKE '%2020-04-%') and the user is a trialist (user_trialist = 1).\n4. Determine aggregation, grouping, ordering: No aggregation is needed; the goal is to list movie titles, so results should be ordered by movie title for clarity.\n5. Handle joins if needed: Join 'ratings' and'movies' on 'user_id' to get movie titles associated with the ratings.\n6. Build subqueries if needed: No subqueries are necessary as the conditions can be directly applied in the WHERE clause.\n7. Formulate final SQL: Select movie titles from the joined tables where the rating timestamp is in April 2020 and the user is a trialist, then order the results by movie title.\n\n### Final SQL:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT m.movie_title\nFROM ratings r\nJOIN movies m ON r.user_id = m.user_id\nWHERE r.rating_timestamp_utc LIKE '%2020-04-%'\n  AND r.user_trialist = 1\nORDER BY m.movie_title;\n``` [End Output] \n\nWait, the schema linking results show that 'user_trialist' is present in both 'ratings' and 'ratings_users' tables. However, the question refers to a user being a trialist, which likely means the user has a trialist status. The 'ratings_users' table might be more appropriate for user trialist status.
