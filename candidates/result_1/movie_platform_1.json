Let's start by understanding what they're asking. The question is: \"State the most popular movie? When was it released and who is the director for the movie?\" \n\nFirst, the user wants the most popular movie. The evidence says that \"most popular\" refers to the maximum value in the movie_popularity column. So I need to find the movie with the highest movie_popularity.\n\nNext, they want to know the release year and the director's name for that movie. The schema linking results show that all the necessary columns—movie_popularity, movie_title, movie_release_year, and director_name—are in the movies table. That means I don't need to join any other tables. \n\nNow, how do I get the most popular movie? Well, I can use the MAX() function on movie_popularity to find the highest value. But I need to get the corresponding movie details. One way is to use a subquery to find the maximum popularity value and then select the movie(s) that have that value. \n\nWait, there's a possibility that multiple movies could have the same maximum popularity. But the user is asking for \"the most popular movie,\" which might imply a single one. However, the query should still handle cases where there are ties. \n\nSo the plan is: first, find the maximum popularity value using a subquery. Then, select all movies that have that popularity value, and from those, get the title, release year, and director. \n\nBut the user might expect just one movie. If there are multiple, the query will return all of them. That's acceptable unless there's a need to handle ties differently, which isn't mentioned here. \n\nSo the SQL would be selecting the required columns from the movies table where movie_popularity equals the subquery that gets the MAX(movie_popularity). \n\nLet me check if there are any other conditions. The evidence doesn't mention any filters, so no additional WHERE clauses. \n\nAlso, the schema linking shows that movie_release_year is in the movies table, and director_name is there too. So all the needed columns are present. \n\nTherefore, the final SQL query should be as written: selecting the three columns where the popularity matches the maximum value found in the subquery. \n\nI think that's all. No joins needed, just a subquery to get the max value and filter the main query.\n```sql\nSELECT movie_title, movie_release_year, director_name\nFROM movies\nWHERE movie_popularity = (\n    SELECT MAX(movie_popularity)\n    FROM movies\n);\n``` [End Output]"
