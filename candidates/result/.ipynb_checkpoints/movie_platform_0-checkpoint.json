From `movies` table: `movie_title`, `movie_release_year`, `movie_popularity`\n   - From `ratings` table: `movie_id`, `ratings` (for popularity, but the schema shows `movie_popularity` directly in `movies`)\n\n3. **Identify filter conditions**:  \n   - The `movie_release_year` must be **1945**.\n\n4. **Determine aggregation, grouping, or ordering**:  \n   - No aggregation required, just **sort by movie_popularity in descending order**.\n\n5. **Handle joins if multiple tables are needed**:  \n   - Since `movie_popularity` is directly in the `movies` table, no join with `ratings` is needed.\n\n6. **Build subqueries if required**:  \n   - No subqueries needed.\n\n7. **Formulate the final SQL query**:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT movie_title\n   FROM movies\n   WHERE movie_release_year = 1945\n   ORDER BY movie_popularity DESC;\n   ```\n\nFinal SQL:\n```sql\nSELECT movie_title\nFROM movies\nWHERE movie_release_year = 1945\nORDER BY movie_popularity DESC;\n``` Now, let's analyze the given question and database schema to create the query plan.\n\n1. **Understand the intent**:  \n   The user wants to **list movie titles** released in the year **1945**, sorted in **descending order** of their **popularity**.\n\n2. **Locate target tables and columns**:  \n   -
