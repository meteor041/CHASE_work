  "text": " sql\n### Query Plan:\n1. **Understand the intent**: The question asks for the longest movie title and its release year. To find the longest movie title, we need to compare the lengths of all movie titles. Once we have identified the longest one, we can then find out when it was released by joining this title with the table that contains the release year.\n2. **Locate target tables and columns**: The main table of interest is `movies` since it contains both movie titles and their release years.\n3. **Identify filter conditions**: We need to filter for the maximum length of movie titles. We also need to filter for the specific movie title that matches this maximum length.\n4. **Determine aggregation, grouping, ordering**: We will aggregate the length of movie titles and group by movie title to ensure we only consider each title once. Then we order by the length in descending order to easily identify the longest title.\n5. **Handle joins if needed**: We need to join the `movies` table with itself based on the movie title to match the longest title with its release year.\n6. **Build subqueries if needed**: No subqueries are needed for this query.\n7. **Formulate final SQL**: \n\n### Final SQL:\n```sql\nSELECT m1.movie_title, m1.movie_release_year \nFROM movies m1\nJOIN movies m2 ON m1.movie_title = m2.movie_title\nWHERE LENGTH(m1.movie_title) = (\n    SELECT MAX(LENGTH(movie_title)) FROM movies\n)\nORDER BY LENGTH(m1.movie_title) DESC LIMIT 1;\n```"
