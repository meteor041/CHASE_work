  "text": " To address the question, we need to calculate the average number of Mubi users who love movies directed by Stanley Kubrick. This involves several steps: identifying the relevant movies, finding the users who love those movies, and then computing the average.\n\n1. **Understand the intent**:  \n   The user wants the **average number of Mubi users** who love movies directed by **Stanley Kubrick**.\n\n2. **Locate target tables and columns**:  \n   - From `movies` table: `movie_id`, `movie_popularity`, `movie_title`  \n   - From `lists` table: `list_movie_number`, `user_id`  \n   - From `lists_users` table: `user_id`  \n   - From `ratings` table: `movie_id`, `user_id`, `rating_score` (to identify users who love the movie)\n\n3. **Identify filter conditions**:  \n   - Filter movies directed by **Stanley Kubrick**.  \n   - Filter users who have a high rating (e.g., rating_score > 4.0) for those movies.  \n   - Ensure the users are Mubi users by checking their presence in `lists_users`.\n\n4. **Determine aggregation, grouping, or ordering**:  \n   - Compute the **average of `movie_popularity`** for movies directed by Stanley Kubrick.  \n   - Count the number of users who love each movie and then take the average.\n\n5. **Handle joins if multiple tables are needed**:  \n   - Join `movies` with `ratings` on `movie_id` to get user ratings.  \n   - Join `ratings` with `lists_users` on `user_id` to ensure users are Mubi users.  \n   - Join `lists` with `lists_users` on `user_id` to associate users with lists.\n\n6. **Build subqueries if required**:  \n   - Use a subquery to filter movies directed by Stanley Kubrick.  \n   - Use a subquery to count the number of users who love each movie.\n\n7. **Formulate the final SQL query**:\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(movie_popularity) AS average_movie_popularity\nFROM movies\nWHERE movie_id IN (\n    SELECT movie_id\n    FROM ratings\n    WHERE user_id IN (\n
