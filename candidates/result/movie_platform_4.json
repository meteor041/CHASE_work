  "text": " \n\n[End Output]\n\n[Your Output]\n\nQuery Plan:\n1. **Understand the intent**:  \n   The user is asking for the **average number of Mubi users** who love movies directed by **Stanley Kubrick**. This implies calculating the **average of movie_popularity** for movies directed by Kubrick.\n\n2. **Locate target tables and columns**:  \n   - From `movies` table: `movie_id`, `movie_popularity`, `movie_title` (to link to directors)\n   - From `ratings` table: `movie_id`, `rating_score` (though not directly used, may be relevant for filtering)\n   - From `ratings_users` table: `user_id` (though not directly needed, may be part of the context)\n   - The director information is not explicitly present in the schema, but the question implies that we need to filter movies directed by Stanley Kubrick. However, the schema does not include a `director` column. This is a potential issue.\n\n3. **Identify filter conditions**:  \n   - Filter movies where the director is **Stanley Kubrick**. However, the schema does not include a `director` column, which makes this condition unimplementable. The question may be based on incorrect schema assumptions.\n\n4. **Determine aggregation, grouping, or ordering**:  \n   - Calculate the **average of movie_popularity** for the relevant movies.\n\n5. **Handle joins if multiple tables are needed**:  \n   - No joins are necessary if the `director` information is not available. However, the schema does not provide a way to filter by director.\n\n6. **Build subqueries if required**:  \n   - No subqueries can be built due to the lack of a `director` column.\n\n7. **Formulate the final SQL query**:  \n   - The query cannot be executed as written due to the absence of a `director` column. The schema provided does not allow filtering by Stanley Kubrick's movies.\n\nFinal SQL:\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(movies.movie_popularity)\nFROM movies\nWHERE movies.movie_title = 'Stanley Kubrick'; -- This is incorrect as it assumes movie_title contains director info\n```\n\nThe query is invalid due to the absence of a director column in the schema.
