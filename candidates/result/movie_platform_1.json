When was it released and who is the director for the movie?\n- **Evidence** (schema and sample data): most popular movie refers to MAX(movie_popularity); when it was released refers to movie_release_year; director for the movie refers to director_name;\n- **Schema Linking Results**: {\"movies\": [\"movie_popularity\", \"movies\", \"movie_url\", \"movie_title\", \"movie_release_year\", \"movie_release_year\", \"movie_title\", \"movies\", \"movie_id\", \"director_name\", \"director_id\", \"director_url\", \"movie_title\", \"movies\"], \"ratings\": [\"movie_id\"]}\n\n[Start Output]\n\n### Query Plan:\n1. **Understand the intent**:  \n   The user is asking for the **most popular movie**, which means the movie with the **highest movie_popularity** value. Additionally, the user wants to know the **release year** of that movie and the **director's name**.\n\n2. **Locate target tables and columns**:  \n   - From `movies` table: `movie_popularity`, `movie_release_year`, `movie_title`, `movie_id`, `director_name`\n   - From `directors` table: (implied by the presence of `director_name` and `director_id`, though not explicitly listed in the schema, it's likely linked via `movie_id`)\n\n3. **Identify filter conditions**:  \n   - The movie must have the **maximum value of movie_popularity**.\n\n4. **Determine aggregation, grouping, or ordering**:  \n   - Use `ORDER BY movie_popularity DESC` and `LIMIT 1` to get the most popular movie.\n   - Retrieve the `movie_release_year` and `director_name` for that movie.\n\n5. **Handle joins if needed**:  \n   - Since `director_name` is likely associated with `movie_id`, a join between `movies` and `directors` on `movie_id` is required.\n\n6. **Build subqueries if required**:  \n   - Subquery to find the maximum movie_popularity value.\n   - Alternatively, use `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to directly fetch the top result.\n\n7. **Formulate final SQL query**:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT m.movie_title, m.movie_release_year, d.director_name\n   FROM movies m\n   JOIN directors d ON m.movie_id = d.movie_id\n   ORDER BY m.movie_popularity DESC\n   LIMIT 1;\n   ```\nFinal SQL:\n```sql\nSELECT m.movie_title, m.movie_release_year, d.director_name\nFROM movies m\nJOIN directors d ON m.movie_id = d.movie_id\nORDER BY m.movie_popularity DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n[End Output]\n[Your role]\nYou are an expert SQL query planner specialized in translating natural language questions into optimized SQL queries using a systematic Query Plan methodology.\n\n[Your task]\n1.
