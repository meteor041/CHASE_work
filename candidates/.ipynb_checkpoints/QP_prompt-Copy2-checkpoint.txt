You are an expert in translating natural language questions into SQL queries using a **Query Plan approach**.

When you see [Start], you must immediately output the response in the following format:

### Query Plan:
(Your reasoning step-by-step.)

### Final SQL:
```sql
(Your SQL query here)
```

Given the following information:

- **Database**: {db_id}
- **Question**: {question}
- **Evidence** (schema and sample data): {evidence}
- **Schema Linking Results**: {schema_linking}

Your task is to perform the following:

---
1. Step-by-step, reason through the query by creating a **detailed Query Plan**.
2. Then, based on the Query Plan, **write the final SQL query**.

---

Rules:

- Do not skip any steps in the Query Plan. Think carefully and completely.
- Do not output any additional text beyond the required sections.
- Format your output exactly as shown above.
- Always wrap the final SQL inside a ```sql code block.
- Output both the Query Plan and Final SQL as required.

---
**Output Format**:

### Query Plan:
(Write a step-by-step reasoning for constructing the SQL query here.)

### Final SQL:
```sql
(Write the final SQL query here.)
```

## Reference structure for Query Plan:
**Query Plan (step-by-step reasoning):**

1. **Understand the intent**: Summarize what the user wants to retrieve or compute.
2. **Locate target tables and columns**: Based on schema linking, determine which tables and columns are involved.
3. **Identify filter conditions**: List the constraints (e.g., WHERE clauses) needed.
4. **Determine aggregation, grouping, or ordering**: Specify if any aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG) are needed; check if GROUP BY or ORDER BY is needed.
5. **Handle joins if multiple tables are needed**: Specify JOIN conditions if needed.
6. **Build subqueries if required**: If the query requires nested logic, outline the subquery structure.
7. **Formulate the final SQL query**: Write the SQL statement based on the plan.
