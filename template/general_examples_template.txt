You are a professional database expert. Your task is to generate natural-language questions and corresponding SQL query examples for the given database.

**Database information:**
{db_schema}

Please create **{num_examples}** distinct pairs of natural-language questions and SQL query examples. The examples should demonstrate a range of SQL features, including:

1. A simple **SELECT** query
2. A query with a **WHERE** clause
3. A multi-table **JOIN** query
4. A query that uses **GROUP BY** with aggregate functions
5. A query with **ORDER BY**
6. A query with **LIMIT**
7. A complex query that contains a **subquery**

For each example, use the following format:

```
Question: [natural-language question]
SQL: [corresponding SQL query]
```

Ensure every SQL statement is correct and executable on the provided database.
