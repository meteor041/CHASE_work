You are a professional database expert. Your task is to **decompose a complex natural language question** into **2 to 4 simpler sub-questions**, each of which can be more easily translated into an individual SQL fragment.

**Database Schema:**
{db_schema}

**Original Question:**
{question}

**Instructions:**
* Break the original question down into **logically sequential sub-questions**.
* Each sub-question should be **atomic** and **specific**, targeting one aspect of the data.
* Do **not** include explanations or SQL queriesâ€”only output the sub-questions as a **numbered list**.

**Output Format:**
1. Sub-question 1
2. Sub-question 2
    ...

### **Example**

**Database Schema:**

```sql
Table: Students(id, name, age, major_id)  
Table: Majors(id, name, department)  
Table: Courses(id, name, instructor_id)  
Table: Enrollments(student_id, course_id, grade)  
Table: Instructors(id, name, department)
```

**Original Question:**
Which students majoring in Computer Science have enrolled in at least 3 courses taught by instructors from the Engineering department?

**Expected Output:**

1. Which students major in Computer Science?
2. Which courses are taught by instructors from the Engineering department?
3. Which of the students from step 1 have enrolled in at least 3 of the courses from step 2?
